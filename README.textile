_This is in alpha stage! It somehow works but is quite far away from show time! 
And it badly lacks documentation._

This Module allows you to manage your page templates, forms and style 
definitions with files.

This means you can dump the contents of any of these to a file, read them from
such a file and, if applicable, inspect the diff between what is configured in the
database.

There are several use cases for this:

# Keep track of templates and styles with a version control such as git, hg, ...
# Easily deploy changes by ftp or version control rathern than perfoming 
  a copy and paste orgy.
# Check if and how data was modified in the database.

Typically you would have it installed on the dev and on the productive system.
Just hack templates and styles on the dev system until you like what you see. 
Dump them to files and move these files to the productive system, where you can
put them in effect with a single mouse click.
